   <p>I am Gurkirat Singh, an aspiring computer programming enthusiast whose fascination with this field took root in childhood. It all started with a simple curiosity, exploring basic programs and games on our family computer. As I ventured deeper, I became entranced by the logical intricacies behind coding, finding joy in the ability to transform lines of code into tangible creations. I devoted endless hours to tutorials, absorbing knowledge and experimenting with various languages, relishing the challenge of debugging and crafting functional code Academically, I have done well in my studies so far. 
   </p>
      <p>I completed my matriculation in 2021 with 81.8%. Considering my ever growing passion for computers I decided to pursue non-medical stream for my senior secondary and completed my twelfth with 67% in 2023. For my higher studies I decided to study abroad and equip myself with a formal qualification in the area of my interest. My search led me to choose to pursue Computer Programming at Lambton College, Canada.</p>
      <p> In lieu of fulfilling my aspiration of upgrading myself and getting quality education from Lambton College, I have met all the basic education and linguistic requirements as I have scored overall 6.5 bands in IELTS exam, which helped me to secure my seat in the college.</p>
